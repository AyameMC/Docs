  // It is highly recommended to use existing licenses, such as CC licenses.
  "license": "CC0-1.0",
  // You can fill in the website where your model is published here, such as the URL of your model release video, and you can also fill in multiple entries.
  "links": [
    "https://example.org"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "example-tag"
  ],
  "animations": [
