### [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ayame-paperdoll) | [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ayame-paperdoll) | [McMod](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/17015.html)
Today, the Ayame PaperDoll mod has passed the Modrinth review (CurseForge and McMod were approved yesterday), so it can be considered officially released. Special thanks to **[LucunJi](https://github.com/LucunJi)** for developing the [Extra Player Renderer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ayame-paperdoll), without which this fork would not have existed!

Ayame PaperDoll is a highly configurable paper doll mod and a fork of [Extra Player Renderer](https://modrinth.com/mod/extraplayerrenderer). It adds support for NeoForge and higher versions of Minecraft, along with more useful key bindings.

### Default Position and Style:

By default, it renders a player model in the top-left corner of the screen and provides a richly customizable configuration screen, which can be accessed through the mod menu or a key binding (default is none). You can also toggle the visibility of the paper doll using a key binding (default is F8).
